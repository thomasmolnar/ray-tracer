To run the code, call the Run function with a certain radius and list of optical elements as arguments (both orientations of the plano-convex lens have already been defined in two lists planoconvex1 and planoconvex2). 

The number of different radii (with default value of 8) and factor by which the number of rays increase (with default value of 10) can also be varied in [config](./config) file of repo.

Results for orientation 1 of plano-convex lens:

[Input Plane 1](./Orientation_1/InputPlane1.pdf "Input Plane of Rays") 

[Propagation 1](./Orientation_1/Propagation1.pdf "Propagation of Rays")

[Output Plane 1](./Orientation_1/OutputPlane1.pdf "Output Plane of Rays")

Results for orientation 2 of plano-convex lens:

[Input Plane 1](./Orientation_2/InputPLane2.pdf "Input Plane of Rays")

[Propagation 1](./Orientation_2/Propagation2.pdf "Propagation of Rays")

[Output Plane 1](./Orientation_2/OutputPlane2.pdf "Output PLane of Rays")
