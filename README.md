# Modelling an optical ray tracer. 

## A collimated beam of a given diameter, represented as an array of rays, was made to propagate through the lens and refract according to Snell’s law. The lens was positioned either in orientation 1, with the planar surface facing the oncoming rays, or in orientation 2, with the curved surface facing the oncoming rays. For each orientation, the paraxial focus was found and for a given beam diameter the RMS radius was found at the focus plane.

To run the code, call the Run function with a certain radius and list of optical elements as arguments (both orientations of the plano-convex lens have already been defined in two lists planoconvex1 and planoconvex2). 

The number of different radii (with default value of 8) and factor by which the number of rays increase (with default value of 10) can also be varied in [config](./config.cfg) file of repo.
